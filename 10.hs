-- Program that goes with "Learn You a Lambda, a Haskell Tutorial", Chapter 6.
-- 
-- We use the QuickCheck library to help check program correctness.
-- E.g. "quickCheck propTerm" will show that all tests pass for the
-- lambda parser given at the end of this file.
--
-- You can use "quickCheck propSpaced" to test solutions to problem 1,
-- or "quickCheck propPretty" to test solutions to problem 2.
